# Editing conventions

1. All source works are to be performed on the **master** branch only.

2. The pages are to be added under `/src/pages` and then described in `/src/data/nav-items.yaml` there is no need of defining the weight.

3. The images should be stored under `/static` (ie `/static/assets`)

	Image references should be using `![Image Alt Text](/path/to/image)`

4. No HTML tag or any text that can be considered as a tag (ie `<variable>`) it should be written as `&lt;variable&gt;`
